### User Story:
Going on the date I want to create a good impression o myself and make sure that the awkward silence will not ruin it.

## MVP:
An application that allows users to choose interesting topics to talk about on the date (hobby, bucket list, historical fact) and create a list of the favourite ones.

### Motivation for Development:
To help users feel themselves more organized, prepared and confident going on the date. To create an useful application with the with a touch of humour.


## Ideas for Future Development:

* Add more topics to choose from.
* Allow user amend favourite list with his own notes, topics, ideas.
* Allow user to add a tick mark to the topics that he already discussed and rate them (from 1 till 10).
* Implement calendar future to be able add future dates to the calendar and to review date history.
* Add functionality to be able to match the date with the topics discussed on it.
